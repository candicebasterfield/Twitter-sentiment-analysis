# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
## Overview
I examine global sentiments on Twitter during and after the lockdown period and then use machine learning methods to classifiy the sentiment in Tweets. 

## Data
Two Billion Multilingual COVID-19 (TBCOV) tweet repository provided by CrisisNLP (includes 800 multilingual COVID-19 related keywords was used to draw a sample.

## Reference:
Muhammad Imran, Umair Qazi, Ferda Ofli. TBCOV: Two Billion Multilingual COVID-19 Tweets with Sentiment, Entity, Geo, and Gender Labels. Data. 2022; 7(1):8. https://doi.org/10.3390/data7010008. 

## Statistical analyses
In the associated R file:

I pre-process the data for sentiment analysis:
    Case normalization: involves converting all the tokens to lowercase ot uppercase to ensure consistency in text.
    Punctuation removal
    Tokenization: process of splitting the sentence into individual words or tokens.
    Lemmatization: reduces words to their base or root form, considering their context and part of speech.
    Stopword removal: commonly used words that do not carry significant meaning are removed to reduce noise.


I then conducted a sentiment anlaysis to examine if sentiment expressed in tweets changes across time and use machine learning methods to classify sentiemnt in tweets.
